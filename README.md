# Bikeshare_Project
#### Data from Divvy covering major bikeshare cities. This project comes from a Udacity course and utilizes Python, specifically Numpy and Pandas.

While doing this project, I utilized **Jupyter Notebook** and **Atom** to adjust the code and **GitBash** to run the code. 

There are **two** files: the python code and the actual data as a zip folder which contains all three cities studied. 

When running this code, it will ask for user input, such as city, months, day of week, and also allow to see the raw data. It will show the most common stations and months, travel times, and client demographics.
